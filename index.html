        Make sure if you are bringing your car, park in an actual parking spot. Not on the lawn. <b>Facility parking lot is still under construction for ten years.</b>
        </li>
    <li class="guide-list">Please get a parking pass or show a parking pass to the security guard. Do not run past the guard, you'll be fired on the spot.</li>
    <li class="guide-list">Make sure you are signed in at every shift or signed out. You will not be paid if you forget!</li>
    <li class="guide-list">Hair nets and beard nets must be worn as soon as you enter the kitchen. If you are bald, speak to management.</li>
    <li class="guide-list">ALL kitchen tasks must be finished before you are dismissed. You will be penalized if there is work left over!</li>
    <li class="guide-list">If the dishwasher is broken, you must wash the utensils by hand.</li>
    <li class="guide-list">Do not talk to other staff members while doing your task. It distracts others from their work. BE RESPECTFUL!</li>
    <li class="guide-list">
        Take breaks at proper times, and do not eat on the units while serving the residents.
